This project is a WhatsApp clone developed with a modern tech stack to mimic the core functionalities of the popular messaging app.

Technologies Used in this application:
Next.js: For server-side rendering and building the user interface.
TypeScript: To add static typing and enhance development efficiency.
React: For building reusable UI components.
Conves: For real-time messaging and chat functionalities. All the data is save here.
Clerk: To handle user authentication and management.
Zego Cloud: To provide video call capabilities.

React Hot Toast Integration
In this WhatsApp clone, I've integrated React Hot Toast to provide a smooth and responsive notification system. React Hot Toast is a lightweight, customizable toast library that allows us to display brief messages to users, such as successful actions, errors, or important alerts.

Zego Cloud
Zego Cloud is integrated into the WhatsApp clone to provide seamless video call functionality. It offers a reliable and scalable solution for real-time communication, enabling users to initiate and participate in high-quality video calls within the app. Zego Cloud's easy-to-use APIs and SDKs made it straightforward to integrate video calling features, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices and network conditions.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
